            <h1>Introduction to TouchDevelop</h1>

            <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>

            <p>In these tutorials we're going to introduce you to the very first step on how to use Microsoft's touchdevelop online coding. In addition, you will also learn some basic fundamentals on how to think like a programmer through some exercises. We will also include some coding knowledge that is commonly used in many programming language, so you can get used to the idea of programming itself. So what are we waiting for? Let's get started! </p>

            <h2>Let's Get Started</h2>

            <p>TouchDevelop is an interactive environment for learning programming. It is mainly designed for mobile devices. It lets you create programs that works on mobile platforms such as iOS, android and windows. Go to this link https://www.touchdevelop.com/. Create an account and log in. You will be directed to the main page as shown in Figure 1. Select you coding skill by clicking the Skill level tab in the main page</p>

            <p>In the main page, click Tutorials. You will be directed to this page shown below. Click the "first steps with turtle" tutorial. If it is not in the featured page you can search for it in the search box in the top left. Also try the other tutorials such as jumping bird, coding jetpack jumper to get yourself familiar with TouchDevelop. If you need more help on using TouchDevelop, check out the TouchDevelop Programming on the Go. Get the book here:<a href="https://www.touchdevelop.com/docs/book">link</a></p>

            <p>This section has the libraries where you see the programs created by other people. You can find a range of functions in these libraries such as datatypes.</p>

            <h2>Creating an App</h2>

            <p>To create an app, click create script, then choose a blank template. </p>

            <p>Well, that's pretty much it to help you start with touchdevelop! But just to make sure it sticks in your brain, we'll just go straight to some tutorials.</p>

            <h2>Creating an Action</h2>

            <p>An action does a task. To create an action, click add new action, the click action. An action contains a function which can be linked to the main function.
