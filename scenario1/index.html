  <h1>What is Computer Science?</h1>

            <p>What is Computer Science? Computer Science encompasses a lot of things, but primarily it's the

theory and method behind telling computers (those big whirry things with the flashing lights that

always break), what we want them to do.<p>

The two real tools of computer science are of course computers, and one of any number of

programming languages that are around. It's easy to think of a computer as an iconic desktop

tower or a sleek laptop, but in reality there are computers at work almost everywhere you look:

from microwaves, to elevators, to your phone, and even in most modern-day televisions. Because

computers are so widespread, how to program them is a very valuable skill which could land you in a valuable,

rewarding career.</p>

These lessons will help introduce you to the fundamentals of computer programming with the help

of Microsoft's TouchDevelop software, as well as a handy little gadget called the Engduino</p>
